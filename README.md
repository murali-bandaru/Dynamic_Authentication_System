# 🔐 Dynamic Authentication System (DAS)

A Python-based **Dynamic Authentication System** that provides core authentication features such as **user registration, login, and user search** using **SQLite3** as the database.  
This project is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and includes **custom exception handling** for better reliability.

## 🚀 Features
- User Registration with email uniqueness validation  
- User Login with credential verification  
- Search User by Email  
- SQLite3 database integration (`DAS.db`)  
- Menu-driven console application  
- Custom exception handling  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- SQLite3  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

📌 How It Works : 

-->The program creates the SQLite database and required tables automatically.

-->Users can register with unique email addresses.

-->Registered users can log in using valid credentials.

-->Users can search for existing user details by email.

-->The application exits safely when selected.

🎯 Learning Outcomes : 

1)Understanding authentication workflows

2)Working with SQLite databases in Python

3)Applying OOP principles in real-world projects

4)Handling errors using custom exceptions
